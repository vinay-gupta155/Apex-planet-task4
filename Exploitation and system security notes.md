Cybersecurity Hands-On:
Pentesting & Defense Lab 🛡️💻A comprehensive documentation of penetration testing methodologies, offensive security exploits, social engineering simulations, and defensive hardening strategies.📌 Project OverviewThis repository serves as a technical log for end-to-end security assessments. It covers the full lifecycle of a cyber attack—from initial reconnaissance to final reporting—alongside the defensive measures required to mitigate these threats.🏗️ 
1. Penetration Testing MethodologyI follow the standard industry lifecycle for all security assessments:Reconnaissance: Gathering intelligence (OSINT, DNS records, subdomains).Scanning: Identifying live hosts, open ports, and running services (Nmap, Nessus).Exploitation: Gaining unauthorized access by exploiting vulnerabilities.Post-Exploitation: Maintaining access, pivoting, and data exfiltration.Reporting: Documenting findings, risk levels, and remediation steps.
   
   🧪 2. Offensive Security LabsA. Exploiting Metasploitable2Target: Metasploitable2 (Intentionally vulnerable Linux VM).Vulnerability: Exploiting vsftpd 2.3.4 (Backdoor) or Samba vulnerabilities.Execution:Using Metasploit Framework: use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor.Payload: Creating a Reverse Shell to gain a bash prompt on the target.Post-Exploitation:sysinfo: Gather OS details.hashdump: Extracting /etc/shadow hashes for offline cracking.B. Credential AttacksBrute-Force: Using Hydra to attack SSH services.Command: hydra -l user -P wordlist.txt ssh://<IP_ADDR>Password Cracking: Using John the Ripper to crack hashes obtained from the hashdump phase.Command: john --wordlist=rockyou.txt hashes.txt🎭
   
   3. Social Engineering & Malware AnalysisPhishing SimulationObjective: Awareness training for internal teams.Setup: Created a cloned login page (using SET or Gophish) to demonstrate how credentials can be harvested via URL spoofing.Defense: Implemented awareness training modules focusing on:Hovering over URLs to check the actual destination.Identifying "Urgency" and "Fear" triggers in email content.Malware Analysis LabStatic Analysis: Examining file headers, strings, and metadata without executing the code.Dynamic Analysis: Running benign samples in a Sandbox Environment (Any.run / Cuckoo Sandbox) to monitor registry changes, network callbacks, and file system modifications.
     
      🛡️ 4. Defensive Hardening (Remediation)After identifying vulnerabilities, the following security controls were applied:Patch Management: Applied critical security patches to the Metasploitable2 kernel and vulnerable services.Firewall Configuration: Configured iptables / ufw to block all ingress traffic except for strictly necessary ports (80, 443).Service Hardening:Disabled unused services (telnet, rsh).Configured SSH to disallow root login and enforce Key-Based Authentication.🛠️ Tools UsedOS: Kali Linux, Parrot Security OS.Scanning: Nmap, Nikto.Exploitation: Metasploit, Hydra, Searchsploit.Cracking: John the Ripper, Hashcat.Defensive: Wireshark, UFW, ClamAV.📝 ReportingEvery lab session concludes with a detailed report including:Executive Summary: High-level risk overview.Technical Details: Step-by-step reproduction of the exploit.Remediation: Short-term and long-term fix recommendations.Disclaimer: All activities in this repository were performed in a controlled, legal lab environment for educational purposes only.
